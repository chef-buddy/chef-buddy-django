# Taste Bud

What should I make for dinner? This is a question many of us ask ourselves
on a regular basis. The TasteBud team set out to solve this dinnertime dilemma by creating an app that suggests recipes for your individual tastes! The more feedback you give TasteBud, the better it can hand pick recipes for you. These recipes aren't picked from in common ingredients, but rather on the underlying flavor compounds that make up those ingredients. When you like or dislike a recipe, TasteBud updates your flavor profile, and comes back with more suggestions. Welcome to a new way to cook!
